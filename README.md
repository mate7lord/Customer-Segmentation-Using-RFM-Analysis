# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-Analysis
Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy in marketing that helps businesses understand their customer base, tailor their marketing efforts, and enhance customer satisfaction. One effective method for customer segmentation is RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. This portfolio demonstrates how to conduct customer segmentation using RFM analysis, highlighting the process, methodology, and insights derived from the analysis.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM analysis. This segmentation will help identify different customer groups, enabling personalized marketing strategies to improve customer retention and increase sales.
# Methodology
The RFM analysis involves three main components:
1. Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
2. Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
3. Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends on purchases.

# Steps :
1. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data.
2. RFM Calculation: Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
3. RFM Scoring: Assign scores to each RFM component.
4. Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their RFM scores.
5. Visualization: Visualize the segments and interpret the results.
